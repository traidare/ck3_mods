# Creating Epidemics -- Practical Recipe

## What You Need to Know First

Epidemics are province-level disease outbreaks that spread across the map. Each
epidemic is linked to a disease trait, has tiered infection levels with
modifiers, and comes in three intensity tiers (minor, major, apocalyptic).
Epidemics are defined in `common/epidemics/` and require a corresponding trait
in `common/traits/`, localization, and optionally custom events.

> Reference docs: references/generated/info/common/epidemics/\_epidemics.info
> Testing: use console command `spawn_epidemic <key> <province_id> <intensity>`
> (e.g., `spawn_epidemic smallpox 2595 apocalyptic`)

 my_plague_default_name: "My Plague"
 my_plague_apocalyptic_name: "The Great Plague"
 epidemic_my_plague: "My Plague"
 trait_my_plague_trait: "My Plague"
 trait_my_plague_trait_desc: "This character is afflicted with the plague."
```

## Common Variants

### Using scripted values for spread (vanilla pattern)

Vanilla epidemics reference script values instead of hard-coded numbers,
allowing global tuning:

```
outbreak_chance = {
	value = outbreak_chance_minor_default_value
	multiply = outbreak_chance_minor_mult_value
	multiply = recent_epidemics_outbreak_mult_value
	# Disable via game rule
	if = {
		limit = { has_game_rule = epidemic_frequency_disabled }
		multiply = 0
	}
}
spread_chance = {
	value = spread_chance_epidemics_default_value
	multiply = spread_chance_epidemics_mult_value
}
```

### County and realm modifiers in infection_levels

Beyond `province_modifier`, infection levels can also apply `county_modifier`
(applied if the county capital is infected) and `realm_modifier` (stacks on the
ruler for every infected province):

```
infection_levels = {
	50 = {
		province_modifier = {
			county_opinion_add = -5
			development_decline = -2
		}
		county_modifier = {
			tax_mult = -0.1
		}
		realm_modifier = {
			monthly_prestige = -0.05
		}
	}
}
```

### Conditional infection (immunity, traits, buildings)

Use `can_infect_character` to make certain characters immune based on traits,
buildings in their capital, or other conditions:

```
can_infect_character = {
	is_alive = yes
	NOT = { has_trait = my_plague_trait }
	NOT = { has_trait = immune_trait }
	# Vanilla uses scripted triggers like:
	# can_contract_disease_trigger = { DISEASE = smallpox }
	# immune_to_epidemic = { EPIDEMIC = scope:epidemic }
}
```

### Dynamic naming with location/ruler/culture

Vanilla epidemics generate thematic names using `first_valid` and `random_valid`
blocks referencing loc keys with scope data:

```
name = {
	first_valid = {
		triggered_desc = {
			trigger = {
				outbreak_intensity = apocalyptic
				outbreak_province = province:3045
			}
			desc = epidemic_special_plague_name    # A unique name for a specific origin
		}
		random_valid = {
			desc = epidemic_realm_plague            # "[outbreak_province.county.holder.primary_title.GetName] Plague"
			desc = epidemic_culture_plague          # "[outbreak_province.county.culture.GetName] Plague"
			desc = epidemic_location_plague         # "Plague of [outbreak_province.county.GetName]"
		}
		desc = trait_my_plague_trait                # Fallback to plain trait name
	}
}
```

### Using on_character_infected for army spread

Vanilla fires events when an infected character is commanding an army:

```
on_character_infected = {
	contract_disease_notify_effect = { DISEASE = my_plague_trait }
	if = {
		limit = { is_commanding_army = yes }
		trigger_event = epidemic_events.0001    # Infects the army
	}
}
```

### on_start / on_end for global state tracking

Use `on_start` and `on_end` to set/clear global variables, e.g., to track
whether a major plague is active:

```
on_start = {
	if = {
		limit = { outbreak_intensity = apocalyptic }
		set_global_variable = my_great_plague_active
	}
}
on_end = {
	if = {
		limit = { outbreak_intensity = apocalyptic }
		remove_global_variable = my_great_plague_active
	}
}
```

### on_monthly for triggering events

Fires monthly for each ruler who has an infected province. Use to trigger
ongoing epidemic event chains:

```
on_monthly = {
	trigger_event = {
		on_action = epidemic_ongoing_events
	}
}
```

### Development loss on province infection

Vanilla applies development loss when a province first becomes infected:

```
on_province_infected = {
	county = {
		apply_infection_development_loss = { BASE = 5 }    # Higher BASE = more dev loss
	}
}
```

### Cooldown on province recovery

Prevents the same epidemic from re-infecting a province too soon:

```
on_province_recovered = {
	add_to_variable_list = {
		name = epidemic_cooldown
		target = scope:epidemic.epidemic_type
		years = 50                                         # This specific disease won't return for 50 years
	}
	set_variable = {
		name = epidemic_cooldown_general
		years = 15                                         # No epidemics at all for 15 years
	}
}
```

## Interactions with Traits and Buildings

- **Trait link**: The `trait` field connects the epidemic to a disease trait.
  Characters in infected provinces get this trait based on
  `character_infection_chance` and `can_infect_character`.
- **Immunity via traits**: Use `can_infect_character` triggers to check for
  immunity traits (e.g., `has_trait = immune_to_plague`). Vanilla uses the
  scripted trigger `can_contract_disease_trigger`.
- **Buildings reducing spread**: Buildings can provide modifiers like
  `epidemic_resistance` or be checked in `can_infect_character` /
  `character_infection_chance` triggers. The `spread_chance` block can also
  check for building presence in the target province.
- **Recovery traits**: Use `on_province_recovered` or disease trait removal
  events to grant recovery/immunity traits.

## Checklist

1. **Epidemic definition** in `common/epidemics/xx_epidemics.txt` with all
   required fields
2. **Disease trait** in `common/traits/` with `is_disease = yes` and appropriate
   penalties
3. **Localization** for:
   - `epidemic_<key>:` -- the epidemic name shown in UI
   - `trait_<trait_key>:` and `trait_<trait_key>_desc:` -- the disease trait
   - Any dynamic name loc keys referenced in the `name` block
4. **Trait icon** at `gfx/interface/icons/traits/<trait_key>.dds` (60x60)
5. **All three intensity tiers** defined (minor, major, apocalyptic) -- each
   needs outbreak_chance, spread_chance, max_provinces, and the three duration
   blocks
6. **At least one infection_level** threshold with province_modifier
7. **on_province_recovered** should set cooldown variables to prevent rapid
   re-infection
8. **Test** with console: `spawn_epidemic <key> <province_id> <intensity>`

## Common Pitfalls

- **Missing trait**: The `trait` field must reference a valid trait key. If the
  trait does not exist, the epidemic will silently fail to infect characters.
- **No `is_disease = yes` on the trait**: Without this flag, the game will not
  treat the trait as a disease for UI and scripted trigger purposes.
- **Forgetting infection_levels**: Without at least one infection_level entry,
  the epidemic will spread but apply no province modifiers, making it invisible
  to the player beyond notifications.
- **character_infection_chance too high**: Vanilla bubonic plague multiplies by
  0.02 on top of the default value to avoid killing every character. A value of
  100 will infect everyone instantly.
- **No cooldown in on_province_recovered**: Without setting `epidemic_cooldown`
  and `epidemic_cooldown_general` variables, the same province can be
  re-infected immediately after recovery.
- **Outbreak_chance too high**: Even small values (0.5-1.0) produce frequent
  outbreaks. Vanilla apocalyptic plagues use values well below 0.1.
- **shader_data channel conflicts**: If two epidemics use the same
  `texture_index` and `channel`, their map visuals will overlap incorrectly. Use
  different channels (red, green, blue, alpha) or different texture indices.
- **Dynamic name loc keys not defined**: If loc keys referenced in the `name`
  block are missing, the epidemic name will show raw keys. Each `desc` in the
  name block must have a matching localization entry.
- **max_provinces as a single value vs range**: `max_provinces` accepts either a
  single value or a `{ min max }` range. Using a range gives natural variation
  between outbreaks.
