# Creating Factions -- Practical Recipe

## What You Need to Know First

Factions are organized groups of vassals (or counties) working against a liege.
When a faction's military power crosses a threshold, it sends an ultimatum; if
the liege refuses, war begins using a specified casus belli.

There are two broad categories:

- **Character-based factions** -- vassals band together (independence, liberty,
  claimant). Members are characters.
- **County-based factions** -- counties revolt on their own (populist, peasant).
  Members are landed titles. A rebel leader may be spawned.

Files go in `common/factions/`. The faction key doubles as the base localization
key.

Key scopes available inside faction blocks:

- `root` = the faction itself (in most blocks)
- `faction_target` = the liege being targeted
- `faction_leader` = the character leading the faction
- `special_character` = e.g. the claimant in a claimant faction
- `special_title` = e.g. the title being claimed
- `scope:target` = the target character (in `can_character_create` and
  `county_create_score`)
- `scope:faction` = the faction (in `ai_join_score`, `can_character_join`,
  `county_join_score`)

## Common Variants

### Claimant Faction (character + title based)

The claimant faction requires both a special character (the claimant) and a
special title.

```
my_claimant_faction = {
    casus_belli = claimant_faction_war

    claimant = yes                     # Marks this as a claimant-type faction
    show_special_title = yes           # Show the claimed title in UI
    character_interaction = create_claimant_faction_against_interaction  # Opens interaction instead of direct create

    name = FACTION_CLAMAINT_DYNAMIC_NAME   # Dynamic name using special_character/title

    # is_valid must check claimant is alive and title is held by target
    is_valid = {
        trigger_if = {
            limit = {
                OR = {
                    exists = special_character
                    exists = faction_war
                }
            }
            special_title.holder ?= faction_target
            OR = {
                special_character ?= {

                }
                exists = faction_war
            }
        }
    }

    # demand effect saves special_character and special_title as scopes
    demand = {

### County-Based Faction (populist/peasant revolts)

Counties revolt based on culture/faith differences with the liege. No character
members needed.

    }

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting the casus belli.** Every faction needs a matching CB in
   `common/casus_belli/`. Without it the faction can never declare war and will
   just sit there indefinitely after sending demands.

2. **Confusing `on_declaration` vs `on_war_start`.** The info file documents
   `on_declaration` but vanilla factions use `on_war_start` for spawning armies
   and setting up war effects. Use `on_war_start` for war-time setup (spawning
   armies, etc.) and `demand` for the ultimatum event chain.

3. **Not disabling county membership on character factions.** Character-based
   factions (independence, liberty, claimant) must set `county_allow_join = no`
   and `county_allow_create = no` or counties will try to join them.

4. **Negative base scores are intentional.** The `ai_create_score` and
   `ai_join_score` use large negative base values (e.g., -150) that must be
   overcome by modifiers. This prevents AI from frivolously creating factions.
   Do not set base to 0 or positive -- factions will form constantly.

5. **Power threshold misunderstanding.** The `power_threshold` is a percentage
   of the liege's military strength. Default is 80 (meaning the faction needs
   80% of the liege's army strength). The `hard_rule_perk` adds +20, making it
   100%. Setting it too low causes constant ultimatums.

6. **County factions need `requires_county = yes` and
   `requires_character = no`.** Without these, county-based factions will be
   destroyed when they have no character members (which is always, since
   counties join, not characters).

7. **Populist factions track faith/culture via variables.** The `on_creation`
   block must set `faction_faith` and `faction_culture` variables from the
   founding county. The `can_county_join` trigger then checks incoming counties
   match this faith. Without this, mixed-faith counties join the same revolt.

8. **`can_character_create_ui` vs `can_character_create`.** The `_ui` variant
   controls the button visibility/enable state in the faction window. If
   omitted, it falls back to `can_character_create`. Use the `_ui` version for
   player-facing tooltip text and the non-UI version for the actual AI/logic
   check.

9. **Missing `is_valid` on claimant factions.** Claimant factions must verify
   the claimant is alive, not incapable, and the target still holds the claimed
   title. If `is_valid` is missing or wrong, the faction persists with a
   dead/invalid claimant.

10. **`multiple_targeting` defaults to no.** Only claimant factions typically
    set `multiple_targeting = yes` so multiple claimant factions can target the
    same liege for different titles. Independence and liberty factions are
    unique per liege by default.

11. **Demand events need a 5-day delay.** Vanilla uses `days = 5` when
    triggering the demand event on the faction target. This gives time for the
    notification event to reach human faction members first. Skipping the delay
    means players in the faction see the result before the notification.

12. **`leader_leaves` is not the same as `character_leaves`.** Use
    `leader_leaves` for special cleanup when the faction leader specifically
    leaves (important for populist factions with spawned rebel leaders). Use
    `character_leaves` for any member departing.
