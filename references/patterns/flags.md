# Flags

Flags are markers used throughout CK3 to track state, tag objects, and gate
logic. There are two fundamentally different kinds of flags in Paradox Script,
and confusing them is a common source of bugs.

## Two Kinds of Flags

### 1. Runtime Flags (Dynamic)

Runtime flags are set and removed during gameplay via effects. They exist on
**characters** and **relations** only. They can have an optional duration after
which they auto-expire.

```pdx
# Set a flag (permanent)
add_character_flag = my_flag

# Set a flag with duration
add_character_flag = {
    flag = my_cooldown_flag
    years = 5
}

# Set with random duration
add_character_flag = {
    flag = my_flag
    days = { 30 90 }   # Random between 30-90 days
}

# Check
has_character_flag = my_flag

# Remove
remove_character_flag = my_flag
```

**Supported scopes for runtime flags:**

| Effect                    | Trigger                   | Scope                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `add_character_flag`      | `has_character_flag`      | character                          |
| `remove_character_flag`   | —                         | character                          |
| `add_dead_character_flag` | `has_dead_character_flag` | character (dead)                   |
| `add_relation_flag`       | `has_relation_flag`       | character (on a scripted relation) |
| `remove_relation_flag`    | —                         | character                          |

That's it. Only characters and relations get runtime flags. There are no
`add_title_flag`, `add_province_flag`, or `add_county_flag` effects — those
don't exist.

### 2. Definition Flags (Static)

Definition flags are declared in data files (`.txt`) as properties of game
objects. They cannot be added or removed at runtime. They are checked with
specialized triggers.

| Object                     | Declared with           | Checked with                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Government**             | `flags = { flag_name }` | `government_has_flag = flag_name`                                   |
| **Trait**                  | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_trait_with_flag = flag_name`                                   |
| **Building**               | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_building_with_flag = { flag = X count >= Y }`                  |
| **Law**                    | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_realm_law_flag = flag_name` / `has_title_law_flag = flag_name` |
| **Innovation**             | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_innovation_flag = flag_name`                                   |
| **Holy site**              | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_holy_site_flag = flag_name`                                    |
| **Legitimacy level**       | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_legitimacy_flag = flag_name`                                   |
| **Trait (on trait scope)** | `flag = flag_name`      | `has_trait_flag = flag_name`                                        |

## Runtime Flags in Detail

### Character Flags

The most commonly used flag type. Character flags are simple boolean markers
attached to a living character.

**Common patterns:**

```pdx
# Event cooldown — prevent the same event from firing twice
immediate = {
    add_character_flag = {
        flag = had_my_event
        years = 10
    }
}
trigger = {
    NOT = { has_character_flag = had_my_event }
}

# One-time decision gate
effect = {
    add_character_flag = completed_my_quest
}
is_valid = {
    NOT = { has_character_flag = completed_my_quest }
}

# Temporary state tracking
add_character_flag = currently_in_ritual
# ... later ...
remove_character_flag = currently_in_ritual
```

**Duration syntax:**

```pdx
# Fixed duration
add_character_flag = { flag = X days = 30 }
add_character_flag = { flag = X weeks = 4 }
add_character_flag = { flag = X months = 6 }
add_character_flag = { flag = X years = 5 }

# Random duration (uniform between min and max)
add_character_flag = { flag = X years = { 3 7 } }

# Permanent (no duration — lasts until removed or character dies)
add_character_flag = X
```

### Dead Character Flags

Dead characters lose all their flags. If you need to check something on a dead
character, use `add_dead_character_flag` (which **requires** a duration):

```pdx
# Must specify duration — dead character flags cannot be permanent
add_dead_character_flag = {
    flag = died_in_battle
    years = 100
}

# Check
has_dead_character_flag = died_in_battle
```

### Relation Flags

Flags on scripted relations (like `friend`, `rival`, `lover`, etc.). These must
be declared in the relation's definition file before use.

```pdx
# In common/scripted_relations/my_relation.txt
my_custom_relation = {
    # ... relation definition ...
    flag = {
        my_relation_flag_a
        my_relation_flag_b
    }
}

# Set a flag on a relation
add_relation_flag = {
    relation = my_custom_relation
    target = scope:other_character
    flag = my_relation_flag_a
}

# Check
has_relation_flag = {
    relation = my_custom_relation
    target = scope:other_character
    flag = my_relation_flag_a
}

# Remove
remove_relation_flag = {
    relation = my_custom_relation
    target = scope:other_character
    flag = my_relation_flag_a
}
```

## Definition Flags in Detail

### Government Flags

Declared in the government definition, checked on any character with that
government. This is the preferred way to gate logic by government type (more
modular than `has_government`).

```pdx
# common/governments/my_governments.txt
my_republic_government = {
    # ...
    flags = {
        government_is_republic
        government_is_settled
        government_allows_trade
    }
}

# Usage in scripts
trigger = {
    government_has_flag = government_allows_trade
}
```

**Why use flags instead of `has_government`?** Multiple governments can share
the same flag. If you check `government_has_flag = government_is_republic`, it
matches any government with that flag — even custom ones added by other mods. If
you check `has_government = republic_government`, it only matches one specific
government.

### Trait Flags

Declared in the trait definition. Useful for checking categories of traits
without listing each one.

```pdx
# common/traits/my_traits.txt
my_warrior_trait = {
    # ...
    flag = warrior_trait
    flag = martial_trait     # Can have multiple flags
}

# Check if character has ANY trait with this flag
has_trait_with_flag = warrior_trait

# Check on the trait scope itself
trigger = {
    has_trait_flag = martial_trait
}
```

Common vanilla trait flags: `education`, `lifestyle`, `commander`,
`personality`, `health`, `genetic`, `fame`, `agent_acceptance_*`,
`ruler_designer_*`.

### Building Flags

Declared in building definitions. Checked on provinces.

```pdx
# common/buildings/my_buildings.txt
my_castle_01 = {
    flag = castle
    flag = fortification
    flag = travel_point_of_interest_martial
    # ...
}

# Check if province has a building with this flag
has_building_with_flag = { flag = fortification count >= 1 }

# Check if province is constructing a building with this flag
has_construction_with_flag = fortification
```

### Law Flags

```pdx
# Check realm law flag
has_realm_law_flag = allows_slavery

# Check title-specific law flag
has_title_law_flag = elective_succession
```

### Innovation Flags

```pdx
# On a culture scope
has_innovation_flag = global_innovation
```

## Variables vs. Flags

Flags are boolean (exists or doesn't). For storing values, use **variables**
instead:

| Need                 | Use                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "Has this happened?" | `add_character_flag`                               |
| "How many times?"    | `set_variable` / `change_variable`                 |
| "Store a reference"  | `set_variable = { name = X value = scope:target }` |
| "Temporary cooldown" | `add_character_flag = { flag = X years = 5 }`      |
| "Permanent counter"  | `change_variable = { name = X add = 1 }`           |

## Pitfalls

1. **Character flags die with the character.** When a character dies, all their
   runtime flags are gone. If you need to persist state after death, use
   `add_dead_character_flag` (requires duration), save to a variable on a title,
   or use dynasty/house modifiers.

2. **There is no `add_title_flag` or `add_province_flag`.** Only characters and
   relations have runtime flags. To track state on a title or province, use
   variables: `set_variable = { name = my_state value = yes }`.

3. **Timed flags are not exact.** `years = 5` means the flag expires after 5
   years of game time, but the check happens on a tick — there may be a brief
   window where it's already expired but hasn't been cleaned up yet.

4. **Flag names are global strings.** There's no namespacing — `my_flag` on
   character A is the same flag name as `my_flag` on character B. Always use
   descriptive, prefixed names: `mymod_had_dragon_event` not `had_event`.

5. **Permanent flags accumulate.** If you `add_character_flag = X` without
   duration on many characters and never remove it, those flags persist for the
   character's lifetime. This is fine for a few flags, but thousands of
   permanent flags on thousands of characters can impact save file size.

6. **`has_character_flag` on a dead character is always false.** Use
   `has_dead_character_flag` instead. This is a common bug in death event
   chains.

7. **Relation flags must be declared in the relation definition.** You can't add
   arbitrary flags to relations — they must be listed in the `flag = { }` block
   of the scripted relation file.

8. **Definition flags can't be added at runtime.** You can't dynamically add a
   flag to a government or trait during gameplay. If you need conditional
   behavior, use a character flag alongside the definition flag.

9. **`government_has_flag` is preferred over `has_government`.** The Paradox dev
   comment in the .info file says: "Use flags instead of has_government for
   moddability if possible." This allows other mods to create new governments
   that work with your code.

10. **Don't confuse `has_trait_with_flag` and `has_trait_flag`.**
    `has_trait_with_flag` is a character-scope trigger (does the character have
    any trait with this flag?). `has_trait_flag` is a trait-scope trigger (does
    this specific trait have this flag?). Different scopes, different uses.
