# Creating Schemes -- Practical Recipe

## What You Need to Know First

Schemes are long-running actions a character performs against a target (usually
another character). They have progress phases, success/failure outcomes,
optional agents, and secrecy mechanics. Defined in
`common/schemes/scheme_types/`. Two major categories exist: **hostile** schemes
(murder, abduct) use agents, secrecy, and resistance; **personal/basic** schemes
(seduce, befriend, sway) are simpler, typically agentless, with milestone events
instead of pulse actions.

Key concepts:

- **Progress** goes from 0 to `base_progress_goal`. Each month, progress has a
  chance to advance based on speed minus resistance.
- **Success chance** starts at `base_success_chance` and grows each completed
  phase by `success_chance_growth_per_skill_point` per owner skill point.
- **Secrecy** (hostile schemes): if the scheme is discovered, it can be exposed.
  `base_secrecy` controls the monthly expose check.
- **Agents** (hostile schemes): other characters who join and boost success
  chance via `agent_success_chance`.
- **Phases**: when progress reaches the goal, `on_phase_completed` fires. For
  agent-based schemes, this loops (success chance grows each phase). For basic
  schemes (`is_basic = yes`), this is typically the final outcome.

```

## Common Variants

### Non-Secret Hostile Scheme

Some hostile schemes don't use secrecy (everyone knows you're doing it):

```
my_open_hostile_scheme = {
    skill = martial
    category = hostile
    target_type = character
    is_secret = no          # No secrecy mechanics at all
    # ...
}
```

### Title-Targeting Scheme

```
my_title_scheme = {
    skill = diplomacy
    category = personal
    target_type = title
    # scope:target is the title, scope:target_title also available
    allow = {
        scope:target = {
            tier >= tier_county
        }
    }
    # ...
}
```

### Scheme with Travel Restrictions

```
my_local_scheme = {
    # ...
    freeze_scheme_when_traveling = yes               # Pauses when owner travels
    freeze_scheme_when_traveling_target = yes         # Pauses when target travels
    cancel_scheme_when_traveling = no                 # Use cancel instead of freeze if needed
    cancel_scheme_when_traveling_target = no
}
```

### Scheme with use_secrecy (Conditional Secrecy)

Seduce uses this: secret only when the relationship would be scandalous.

```
my_conditional_secret_scheme = {
    is_secret = yes
    use_secrecy = {
        # Return false to force secrecy to 100% (effectively not secret)
        # Return true to use normal secrecy mechanics
        scope:target = {
            is_spouse_of = scope:owner  # Only secret if targeting someone else's spouse
        }
    }
}
```

### Scheme with on_start (Setup Logic)

```
my_scheme = {
    on_start = {
        # Runs once when scheme begins
        # Good for: adding agent slots, setting variables, firing intro events
        add_agent_slot = agent_assassin
        add_agent_slot = agent_infiltrator
    }
}
```

### AI Behavior

Schemes don't have an `ai_will_do` block themselves. AI scheme usage is
controlled by:

1. **Character interactions** -- the interaction that starts the scheme has
   `ai_will_do`
2. **`agent_join_chance`** -- controls whether AI characters join as agents
3. **`on_semiyearly`** -- used for AI agent management
4. **`allow` triggers** -- AI-specific conditions can be added with
   `trigger_if = { limit = { is_ai = yes } ... }`

```
# In the scheme definition, restrict AI behavior via allow:
allow = {
    trigger_if = {
        limit = { is_ai = yes }
        # AI-only restrictions
        scope:target = {
            NOT = {
                any_targeting_scheme = {
                    scheme_type = my_scheme
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# AI agent management in on_semiyearly:
on_semiyearly = {
    if = {
        limit = { scheme_owner = { is_ai = yes } }
        # AI assigns agents, prunes slots, etc.
    }
}
```

## Event Scopes Available in Scheme Context

- `scope:scheme` -- the scheme itself
- `scope:owner` / `scheme_owner` -- character running the scheme
- `scope:target` / `scheme_target_character` -- the target character (if
  target_type = character)
- `scope:target_title` / `scheme_target_title` -- the target title (if
  target_type = title)
- `scope:agent` -- the specific agent (in agent-related effects like
  `on_agent_exposed`)
- `root` -- in `agent_join_chance`, root is the potential agent being evaluated

## Relevant Modifiers (applied to characters)

- `max_<scheme_name>_schemes_add` -- how many of this scheme type a character
  can run
- `max_hostile_schemes_add` / `max_personal_schemes_add` -- category-wide caps
- `<scheme_name>_speed_add` / `<scheme_name>_speed_mult` -- speed bonuses
- `<scheme_name>_resistance_add` / `<scheme_name>_resistance_mult` -- resistance
  bonuses
- `hostile_scheme_phase_duration_add` / `personal_scheme_phase_duration_add` --
  phase duration modifiers
- `owned_hostile_scheme_success_chance_add` /
  `enemy_hostile_scheme_success_chance_add` -- success chance
- `enemy_scheme_secrecy_add` -- reduces secrecy of schemes targeting you (use
  negative values)

## Relevant Loc Functions

- `[SCHEME.GetName]` -- scheme type name
- `[SCHEME.GetAction]` -- action verb (e.g., "Murder")
- `[SCHEME.GetFullActionName]` -- action + target (e.g., "Murder Duke William")
- `[SCHEME.GetOwner]` -- scheme owner
- `[SCHEME.GetTarget]` -- scheme target
- `[SCHEME.GetSecrecy]` -- secrecy as number
- `[SCHEME.GetSpeed]` / `[SCHEME.GetResistance]` / `[SCHEME.GetSpeedDifference]`
- `[SCHEME.GetProgress]` -- current progress
- `[SCHEME.IsSecret]` / `[SCHEME.IsFrozen]` / `[SCHEME.IsOwnerExposed]`

## Checklist

- [ ] Scheme file in `common/schemes/scheme_types/` with `.txt` extension
- [ ] `skill` set (intrigue, diplomacy, martial, stewardship, learning, prowess)
- [ ] `category` set (hostile, personal, or contract)
- [ ] `target_type` set (character, title, culture, faith, or nothing)
- [ ] `allow` block -- who can start the scheme
- [ ] `valid` block -- ongoing validity (checked daily)
- [ ] `base_success_chance` block with at least a base value
- [ ] `on_phase_completed` -- what happens when a phase ends
- [ ] `cooldown` set to prevent spam
- [ ] If hostile: `agent_join_chance`, `agent_groups_*`, `base_secrecy`,
      `on_monthly` with discovery check
- [ ] If basic: `is_basic = yes`, milestone events in `on_monthly`
- [ ] Localization: `<scheme_key>`, `<scheme_key>_action`, `<scheme_key>_desc`,
      plus all `desc` strings used in modifiers
- [ ] Events for outcomes referenced in `on_phase_completed` and
      `on_invalidated` actually exist
- [ ] Pulse actions (if any) defined in `common/schemes/pulse_actions/` and
      referenced in `pulse_actions = { entries = { ... } }`
- [ ] Test: start the scheme via the character interaction or console

## Common Pitfalls

- **Missing `_action` loc key**: The game uses `<scheme_key>_action` for the
  button text (e.g., "Murder"). Without it, you get a raw key in the UI
- **Forgetting `on_invalidated`**: If your scheme has no invalidation handler,
  the player gets no feedback when the scheme ends unexpectedly (target dies,
  goes out of range, etc.)
- **`is_basic = yes` implications**: Basic schemes skip agents, success chance
  growth, and pulse actions entirely. Don't define `agent_join_chance` or
  `pulse_actions` for basic schemes -- they'll be ignored
- **`base_progress_goal` confusion**: For agent-based schemes, lower values
  (like 20) mean faster phases with multiple loops. For basic schemes, higher
  values (like 365) approximate real time in days. The actual duration depends
  on speed vs resistance
- **`speed_per_skill_point` sign**: For basic schemes, vanilla uses negative
  values (e.g., `-2.5`) because the system subtracts from `base_progress_goal`.
  For agent-based schemes, positive values add to monthly progress chance
- **`valid` vs `allow`**: `allow` is checked once when starting. `valid` is
  checked every day while the scheme runs. Put expensive triggers in `allow`,
  not `valid`
- **Agent scope in `agent_join_chance`**: `root` is the potential agent, NOT the
  scheme owner. Use `scope:owner` for the scheme owner and `scope:target` for
  the target
- **Missing discovery check**: Hostile secret schemes need
  `hostile_scheme_monthly_discovery_chance_effect = yes` in `on_monthly`, or
  they'll never be discovered
- **Modifier `desc` keys**: Every `modifier` block in `base_success_chance`
  should have a `desc` key. Missing it means the tooltip shows no explanation
  for that bonus/penalty
- **Cooldown scope**: Cooldown applies per owner-target pair for the same scheme
  type. A 10-year cooldown means that specific owner can't use that scheme type
  on that specific target for 10 years
- **Pulse actions file location**: Pulse actions go in
  `common/schemes/pulse_actions/`, NOT in `common/schemes/scheme_types/`. They
  use a different format (see vanilla `general_scheme_pulse_actions.txt`)
