# Great Projects

## What You Need to Know First

- Great Projects are large-scale construction endeavors (wonders, monuments,
  campaigns) that characters plan, fund, and build over time. Added in the Roads
  to Power / Tides of Power DLC era.
- Defined in `common/great_projects/types/` as `.txt` files.
- A great project has a **planning phase** (founder commits initial cost), a
  **funding phase** (contributions are funded by the owner and optionally by
  vassals/allies/tributaries), and a **construction phase** (time passes until
  completion).
- Each project has **contributions** -- individual sub-items that need funding.
  Contributions can be required or optional. All required contributions must be
  funded before construction begins.
- `owner` determines who controls the project. Options: `province_owner`,
  `province_owner_top_liege`, `founder_primary_title_owner`,
  `founder_top_liege_title_owner`.
- `province_filter` controls which provinces appear as valid locations during
  planning (same rules as Activities).
- `group` controls UI presentation: `major_project`, `minor_project`, or
  `environmental_project` (hides owner portrait).

### Localization Keys

- **Project type name**: `great_project_type_<key>`
- **Project type tooltip**: `great_project_type_tooltip_<key>`
- **Ongoing project name** (default): `great_project_name` -- override with
  `great_project_name_<key>`
- **Ongoing project possessive** (default): `great_project_name_possessive` --
  override with `great_project_name_possessive_<key>`
- **Contribution name**:
  `great_project_type_<project_key>_contribution_<contribution_key>`
- **Contribution desc**:
  `great_project_type_<project_key>_contribution_<contribution_key>_desc`
- **Ongoing contribution name** (default): `great_project_contribution_name` --
  override with
  `great_project_<project_key>_contribution_name_<contribution_key>`

### Scope Reference

Most triggers and effects receive:

- `root` = the great project itself (or the character in
  `can_start_planning`/`is_shown`)
- `scope:province` = province where the project is located
- `scope:great_project` = the project (null before planning phase in
  contributions)
- `scope:owner` = the character who currently owns the project
- `scope:founder` = the character who originally planned the project

## Common Variants

### Trigger-Based Illustrations (regional variation)

```
illustration = {
    trigger = {
        scope:province ?= {
            geographical_region = world_asia
        }
    }
    reference = "gfx/interface/illustrations/great_projects/monument_asia.dds"
}
illustration = {
    # Fallback (no trigger = always matches)
    reference = "gfx/interface/illustrations/great_projects/monument_default.dds"
}
```

### Trigger-Based Names

```
name = {
    trigger = {
        scope:province ?= {
            terrain = mountains
        }
    }
    desc = great_project_type_mountain_fortress
}
name = {
    desc = great_project_type_my_grand_monument   # fallback
}
```

### Owner-Only Contribution (no vassals allowed)

```
sacred_consecration = {
    allowed_contributor_filter = {
        owner = yes
    }
    contributor_is_valid = {
        piety_level >= high_piety_level
    }
    cost = {}   # no currency cost, just meeting the trigger
    is_required = yes

    ai_will_do = { value = 1000 }
    ai_check_interval_by_tier = {
        barony = 0
        county = 3
        duchy = 3
        kingdom = 3
        empire = 3
        hegemony = 3
    }
}
```

### Environmental / System-Spawned Project (not player-initiated)

```
great_project_disaster_relief = {
    # Players cannot plan or cancel this -- it is spawned by events
    can_start_planning = { always = no }
    can_cancel = { always = no }

    is_valid = {
        exists = var:situation   # tied to a situation
    }

    construction_time = 60
    group = environmental_project   # hides owner portrait
    # ...
}
```

### Contribution with show_in_planning_phase

```
secret_chamber = {
    is_required = no
    show_in_planning_phase = no   # hidden until funding phase begins
    # ...
}
```

### Different Contributor Filters at Contribution Level

```
allied_support = {
    allowed_contributor_filter = {
        allies = yes
    }
    # Overrides the project-level filter for this specific contribution
}
```

## Checklist

### Files to create or modify:

1. `common/great_projects/types/my_great_projects.txt` -- project definition
   with contributions
2. `localization/english/great_projects/my_great_projects_l_english.yml` -- all
   loc keys
3. Icon image at the path specified in `icon.reference` (DDS format, placed in
   `gfx/interface/icons/great_projects/`)
4. Illustration image at the path specified in `illustration.reference` (DDS
   format, placed in `gfx/interface/illustrations/great_projects/`)
5. (Optional) Events triggered by `on_complete`, `on_cancel`, etc. in `events/`
6. (Optional) Scripted effects/triggers in `common/scripted_effects/` and
   `common/scripted_triggers/` for reuse

### Validation checks:

- [ ] At least one `project_contributions` entry exists (minimum 1 required)
- [ ] At least one contribution has `is_required = yes` (or uses default, which
      is yes)
- [ ] `province_filter` is set appropriately (capital, realm, domain, etc.)
- [ ] `owner` type is set (province_owner, province_owner_top_liege, etc.)
- [ ] `construction_time` is defined (in days)
- [ ] `cost` block is present (even if empty for system-spawned projects)
- [ ] All `ai_check_interval_by_tier` blocks define all six tiers: barony,
      county, duchy, kingdom, empire, hegemony
- [ ] `ai_target_quick_trigger` is defined with at minimum `adult`, `rank`
- [ ] Loc keys exist for project type name, tooltip, and each contribution
      name + desc
- [ ] `is_shown` prevents the project from appearing when it shouldn't (e.g.,
      already planning, wrong government)
- [ ] `can_start_planning` includes
      `NOT = { is_planning_great_project = <key> }` to prevent duplicates
- [ ] `is_valid` checks are meaningful (what invalidates an ongoing project?)
- [ ] Icon and illustration image files exist at the referenced paths

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing contribution**: Every great project must have at least one entry in
   `project_contributions`. A project with zero contributions will not function.

2. **Forgetting `is_planning_great_project` guard**: If you do not check
   `NOT = { is_planning_great_project = my_project }` in both `is_shown` and
   `can_start_planning`, the player can start multiple instances of the same
   project.

3. **Incomplete `ai_check_interval_by_tier`**: All six tiers (barony, county,
   duchy, kingdom, empire, hegemony) must be defined. Missing a tier causes
   errors. Set tiers to `0` to exclude them.

4. **Confusing project-level vs contribution-level AI**: The project has its own
   `ai_will_do` and `ai_check_interval_by_tier` (controls whether AI starts the
   project). Each contribution also has its own (controls whether AI funds that
   contribution). Both need to be set.

5. **`ai_check_interval` units differ**: At the project level,
   `ai_check_interval` and `ai_check_interval_by_tier` are in **years**. At the
   contribution level, they are in **months**. Mixing these up causes AI to
   check far too often or too rarely.

6. **Wrong scope in `can_start_planning`**: In `can_start_planning`, `root` is
   the **character** planning the project, not the project itself. In `is_valid`
   and lifecycle effects, `root` is the **project** and the character is
   `scope:owner`.

7. **Optional contributions after threshold**: Optional contributions
   (`is_required = no`) cannot be funded after the `contribution_threshold`
   percentage of progress is reached. If you set this too low, optional
   contributions become nearly impossible to fund.

8. **Loc key pattern mismatch**: The contribution loc key pattern is
   `great_project_type_<PROJECT>_contribution_<CONTRIBUTION>` -- note
   `great_project_type_` prefix includes `_type_`, not just `great_project_`.
   Missing this prefix causes raw key display.

9. **`contributor_cooldown` vs `construction_time`**: The `contributor_cooldown`
   at the project level controls how long non-founders must wait before they can
   start funding any contributions (giving the founder a head start). The
   per-contribution `contributor_cooldown` controls how long after funding one
   contribution before the same character can fund another on the same project.

10. **Missing `on_cancel` cleanup for contributors**: When a project is
    cancelled, contributors who funded contributions get nothing. Vanilla
    handles this by iterating `every_contribution` and applying opinion
    penalties. Forgetting this makes cancellation feel consequence-free.

11. **`owner` type mismatch with `province_filter`**: If
    `province_filter = capital` but `owner = province_owner_top_liege`,
    ownership transfers to the top liege, which may not be the founder. Make
    sure the ownership model matches your design intent.

12. **Image paths**: Icon images go in `gfx/interface/icons/great_projects/` and
    illustration images go in `gfx/interface/illustrations/great_projects/` (or
    similar). Use DDS format. Missing images cause blank UI elements, not
    errors.
