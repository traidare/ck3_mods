# Creating Governments -- Practical Recipe

## What You Need to Know First

Governments define how a ruler's realm operates: which holdings they use, how
vassals contribute taxes/levies, what succession rules apply, what AI behaviors
are enabled, and what modifiers the ruler gets. They are defined in
`common/governments/` and need localization plus a map color.

Key concepts:

- **government_rules**: A bitmask of boolean flags that toggle hardcoded
  mechanics (councils, dynasties, legitimacy, raiding, administrative features,
  etc.).
- **mechanic_type**: Links the government to a hardcoded "family" (feudal, clan,
  theocracy, administrative, nomad, etc.). Only one government per mechanic_type
  should be `is_mechanic_type_default = yes`.
- **fallback**: At least one government must be a fallback (priority 1 =
  highest). Used when no other government is valid for a character.
- **Holdings**: `primary_holding` is the main type; `valid_holdings` lists
  additional types the ruler can directly hold; `required_county_holdings` lists
  what must exist in a county before extras can be built.
- **vassal_contract_group**: Points to a vassal contract defined in
  `common/vassal_contracts/`. Determines tax/levy obligations.
- **flags**: Custom string flags testable via `government_has_flag`. Preferred
  over `has_government` checks for moddability.
- **character_modifier / top_liege_character_modifier**: Static modifiers
  applied to all rulers (or only independent top lieges) with this government.

### Localization (localization/english/my_government_l_english.yml)

```
l_english:
 my_custom_government: "My Custom Government"
 my_custom_government_desc: "Rulers of this government type hold castles and manage feudal-style contracts."
```

The localization key is the government's database key. The `_desc` variant is
shown in tooltips.

## Checklist

1. **File created**: `common/governments/my_government_types.txt` with your
   government definition.
2. **Localization**: `localization/english/my_government_l_english.yml` with
   `my_government_key` and `my_government_key_desc`.
3. **primary_holding** set and the holding type exists in `common/holdings/`.
4. **valid_holdings** includes any extra holding types the ruler can hold
   directly.
5. **required_county_holdings** lists what must be present before
   duplicates/extras can be built.
6. **vassal_contract_group** points to a valid group in
   `common/vassal_contracts/`. If creating a new group, define it there.
7. **can_get_government** trigger returns true for intended characters (check
   culture, faith, DLC flags as needed).
8. **flags** defined -- use `government_has_flag = my_flag` in scripts instead
   of `has_government` where possible.
9. **character_modifier** reviewed -- modifiers must be generic (hardcoded) or
   from schemes/holdings/lifestyles/regions databases only.
10. **color** set -- uses `hsv{ h s v }` or `rgb{ r g b }` or `{ r g b }` (0-255
    integers).
11. **No duplicate mechanic_type defaults** -- only one government per
    mechanic_type should have `is_mechanic_type_default = yes`.
12. **AI block** reviewed -- disable features (arrange_marriage, use_goals,
    etc.) only for non-playable governments like mercenaries/holy orders.

## Pitfalls

### "My government doesn't appear / characters revert to feudal"

- **can_get_government** trigger is failing. Check DLC flags, culture/heritage
  requirements, and faith conditions. A character who fails this trigger gets
  assigned the fallback government instead.
- If you set `mechanic_type` to one that requires a DLC (e.g., `administrative`
  needs Roads to Power), characters without the DLC will fail silently.

### "Vassals give no taxes or levies"

- The **vassal_contract_group** must point to an existing contract in
  `common/vassal_contracts/`. If you create a custom group, it needs its own
  file with obligation definitions and localization.
- Administrative governments use treasury-based economics (`treasury = yes`,
  `replace_gold_cost_by_treasury = yes`). Without these, admin vassals may
  produce no gold income.

### "Character modifier not working"

- Government `character_modifier` only supports **generic hardcoded modifiers**
  and modifiers generated from schemes, holdings, lifestyles, and regions.
  Modifiers from other governments, men_at_arms_types, cultures, or terrain are
  NOT allowed here.

### "Map color not showing / wrong color"

- `color` must be defined. Accepts `hsv{ h s v }`, `rgb{ r g b }`, or bare
  `{ r g b }` (integers 0-255). Missing color causes invisible map mode.
- `realm_mask_offset` and `realm_mask_scale` control the realm map pattern --
  set them or inherit visual glitches.

### "AI rulers do nothing / act weird"

- Unplayable governments (mercenaries, holy orders, herders) should disable most
  AI features: `arrange_marriage = no`, `use_goals = no`,
  `use_scripted_guis = no`, `perform_religious_reformation = no`,
  `use_legends = no`.
- Playable governments should leave AI defaults as `yes` unless you have a
  specific reason to disable something.

### "Inheritance breaks across government types"

- `inherit_from_dynastic_government = no` prevents dynastic-government
  characters from inheriting titles held by this government. Administrative and
  theocratic governments use this to stop feudal rulers from absorbing their
  land.
- `compatible_government_type_succession` can whitelist specific other
  government types as valid succession candidates (used by Japan's
  Ritsuryo/Soryo pair).

### "Ruler can hold multiple primary-tier titles unexpectedly"

- `admin_allows_holding_multiple_primary_tier_titles = yes` enables this for
  administrative governments. Only affects appointment/succession transfers. Set
  to `no` to restrict.

### "Government flags vs has_government"

- Prefer `government_has_flag` checks in triggers and effects. Flags are
  moddable (other mods can add/remove them); `has_government` is a hard
  reference to a specific government key.
- Vanilla uses flags like `government_is_settled`,
  `government_uses_crown_authority`, `government_uses_domain_limit`,
  `government_can_raid_rule` for cross-government behavior.

### "opinion_of_liege shows raw loc key"

- If you define `opinion_of_liege`, you must also define `opinion_of_liege_desc`
  with the matching localization key. The `desc` string must exist in your loc
  files or it displays raw.

### "DLC-gated features silently fail"

- `administrative = yes` requires `dlc_flag admin_gov` (Roads to Power DLC).
- `landless_playable = yes` requires `dlc_flag landless_playable`.
- `uses_county_fertility = yes` / `obedience = yes` are nomad/herder features
  from Wandering Nobles DLC.
- Always gate `can_get_government` with the relevant DLC trigger (e.g.,
  `has_tgp_dlc_trigger = yes`).

### "prestige_opinion_override has wrong number of values"

- The array length must match the define `NCharacterOpinion::PRESTIGIOUS`.
  Vanilla tribal uses 6 values: `{ -10 0 3 5 10 20 }`. Too few or too many
  values cause errors.
